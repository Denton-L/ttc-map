# ttc-map

A representation of Toronto's subway system using only git commits because our subway is so simple, it can be represented using a DAG. Inspired by [vbarbaresi/MetroGit](https://github.com/vbarbaresi/MetroGit).

Here are some viewing options:

* [GitHub's network view.](https://github.com/Denton-L/ttc-map/network)
* Clone and view using `gitk`.
* Clone and view using `git log --all --graph`.

The original map of the TTC subway system is below.
